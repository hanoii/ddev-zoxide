# ddev-zoxide <!-- omit in toc -->

For now, I won't be providing releases, please install with 

```
ddev get https://github.com/hanoii/ddev-zoxide/tarball/main
```

This adds [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) to the container. 

This is for those of you who `ddev ssh` a lot and `cd` around. It's a simlar
tool like z, autojump and ohters. It's looks very actively supported and well
thought.
